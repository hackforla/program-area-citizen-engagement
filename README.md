# Program Area - Citizen Engagement

Welcome to the Program Area for Citizen Engagement. 

Citizen Engamenment is a program of Hack for LA. Hack for LA is a brigade of a Code for America. This Program is envisioned to Create a Central hub for communication protocol between various Hack for LA Team's with Neighborhood Council or different Business Opportunities.

### Project context

Civic projects often exist within a larger context that may include multiple stakeholders, historic relationships, associated research, or other details that are relevant but not *required* for direct contributions. More information could be found at [link to a Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iZjqmUPNCy0t54STBjX7Rc2s9nwzmt8Q)

### Technology used

- Each platform or framework should get its own bullet.
- Each platform should include an [active link](#) to the official documentation.



# How to contribute

Explain the different ways people can contribute. For example:

- Join the team {on Slack/at our weekly hack night/etc}.
- To help with user research, {do ABC}.
- To provide design support, {do XYZ}.
- To contribute to the code, follow the instructions below.

Remember to provide direct links to each channel.



## Installation instructions

1. Step-by-step instructions help new contributors get a development environment up and running quickly.
2. You'll want to find the balance between being specific enough for novices to follow, without being so specific that you reinvent the wheel by providing overly-basic instructions that can be found elsewhere.
3. Feel free to adapt this section and its sub-sections to your own processes.
4. Alternatively, you can move everything from *Installation instructions* through *Testing* to a separate **Contributing.md** file to keep your **ReadMe.md** more succinct.


### Working with issues

- Explain how to submit a bug.
- Explain how to submit a feature request.
